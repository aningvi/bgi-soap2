.SH NAME
.PP
SOAP.coverage \- Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package - Multi functional coverage analyzer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
soap.coverage -cvg|-phy -il soap-results-list -o output [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
SOAP.coverage is a member of the SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package). This utility can calculate sequencing coverage or physical coverage as well as duplication rate and details of specific block for each segments and whole genome by using SOAP, BLAT, BLAST, BlastZ, mummer and MAQ aligement results with multi-thread. Gziped file supported.
.PP
SOAP.coverage is benefitted in time and space efficiency by a specific design in the basic data structures and algorithms used.
.SH COMMAND AND OPTIONS
.PP
.B soap
-D <in.fasta.index> -a <query.file.a> [-b <query.file.b>] -o <alignment.output> [-2 <unpaired.output>] [options]
.P
.B OPTIONS:
.RS
.TP

.TP
.B -o STR
Results output file
.TP
.B -refsingle STR
Input reference file in FASTA format
.TP
.B -cvg or -phy
Switch for sequencing coverage or physical coverage. At least one should be selected
.TP
.B -depthsingle STR or -depthsinglebin STR
Output file with coverage of each bp in plain text or binary. See APPENDIX for detailed descrption for binary format.
.TP
.B -addn STR
Mask specific areas provided in file. For input format please type "soap.coverage -h"
.TP
.B -plot STR INT INT
Plot coverage distribution within certain range to a file
.TP
.B -cdsinput
Calculate specific area's detailed information. For input format please type "soap.coverage -h"
.TP
.B -cdsdetail STR
Should be used with cdsinput for output file path
.TP
.B -cdsplot STR INT INT
Plot coverage distribution of specific areas within certain range to a file
.TP
.B -window STR INT
Output coverage averaged in a [INT] long window to [STR]
.TP
.B -p
Number of processor. Default = 4
.TP
.B -trim INT
Exclude [INT] bp at head and tail of each segment
.TP
.B -pslsub or -pslquery or -m8subject or -m8query or -axtoitg or -axtoiq or -mummerquery of -maq
File format switches.
.TP
.B -onlyuniq
Use reads those are uniquely mapped (column 4 in soap == 1)
.TP
.B -precise
Omit mismatched bp in soap result
.TP
.B -onlycover
Output 0 for no cover and 1 for covered
.TP
.B -p INT
Multithreads, n threads, [1]
.SH APPENDIX
.PP
Provide correct reference and make sure right parameters are used, or you will get termination and tips.
.RS
.P
.B NOTE:
1. the reference input should only be FASTA format; 2. Depth output would be as large as 10 to 15 GB, use binary output if possible. The binary format is: 1*[ulong(x)]-x*{[ulong(len)]-[char[len](name)]-[ulong(len2)]-[ushort[len2](bp)]}. (ulong for unsigned long and ushort for unsigned short in C++)
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The datastructure is imcompatible with 32bit, so it can't be migrated on any 32bit platforms.
The current version can only run on 
.B x86_64 platform.
We will provide a universal version for most of the 64bit platform later.
.TP
.B HARDWARE REQUIREMENT
.RS
1.6Gb RAM (for a genome as large as human's)
.P
2.at least 8Gb hard disk to store a refsingle output (for a genome as large as human's)
.RE
.TP
.B SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
.RS
Linux x86_64

.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.PP
Thanks for XiaoDong Fang's initial idea on writing a time and space efficient coverage analyzer as well as YingRui Li, HanCheng Zheng and Chang Yu's suggestions on improving this utility.
